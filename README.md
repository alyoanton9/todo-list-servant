# TODO-list by Servant

This code complements the talk "How to choose Haskell web framework" I presented at [Haskell eXchange 2022](https://skillsmatter.com/skillscasts/18103-how-to-choose-a-haskell-web-framework).

There will be a proper description of how to set up and run the project. Also, the same instructions will be added for:
- [TODO-list by Yesod](https://github.com/alyoanton9/todo-list-yesod)
- [TODO-list by IHP](https://github.com/alyoanton9/todo-list-ihp)

Just wait a bit :)
